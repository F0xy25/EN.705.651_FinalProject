tasked for making this for multiple guests with different perspectives
	first thing we need to do is update preferences
	in the initializer - we have a random amount of users on each path 
	the main changes are in call node 2 and 3
	originally parsing was just for the original state and now we have prompting and parsing for each user right now 2 to 4 and that can get 2 to 4 times more expensive and create a loop for each user
	it's now user's sentiment in call node 2

in node 3 we changed the prompt for each user in the prompt of state 

then we can choose to aggregate the group happiness

or we can test on an individual guest or key guest

we can then set a threshold for the overall happiness

if we set to 0 the code will stop right away after these people start complaining because 0 threshold of happiness is good enough

if we change it to .6 it will take a lot longer to get to that happiness level and will most likely reach a recursion limit

alternatively, we can set it to a key guest which will run much 

the smart building is going off of optimal ranges and we haven't really made a way 

change lines 502 and 503 to change from key guest to aggregate

couldn't get key guest to interact with group properly
