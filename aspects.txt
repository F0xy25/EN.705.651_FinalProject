Use these aspects of reasoning:

Emotional Relevance (LOW/MED/HIGH)
  - High when there is a combination of building state variables which are out of optimization ranges
  - Low when just one building state variable is off (this is less overwhelming to the event-goer)
  - High when there is a high range of divergence from the optimal range
  - Low when a variable out of range is close to the optimal range (maybe no one can tell)

Time Sequencing
  - How adaptive the update will be to additional updates.  Will changing room location fix all the issues temporarily?
  - Can multiple steps be resolved by sequencing effectively?
        Turning down the music could make the room less hot, and changing the music could distract from the temp (correlated
        variables like that - where one update makes the others seem to go away.
  - Can unique variables not defined in the user optimization goals be useful to make people happy until others can be
        updated?  Like looking ahead to see if they can be used to prevent people from getting too grumpy.

Wild Card Variables
  - Wild card variables are the 'event bot' and the 'announcement' options for building state.
  These are event adaptation options which are correlated with the building environment variables when they are used,
  but it is less straightforward how they might affect the vibe, and channel the future of the space for increasing
  happiness levels.  It might not be directly obvious how to use them but they carry significant sway in happiness levels
  and you can explain why in the explainations for unique reasoning nuances.

Nuances in reasoning (unique reasoning nuances)
  - What isn't already covered by the logic of this reasoning process described which could be improved by the update
  that is the most critical added thing in the reasoning for the update?

Use a selection of one to all of the following techniques and include which one in the 'unique reasoning nuances' text
along with the specific uniqueness that was discovered from the approach.
-- Generate examples which provide context on environmental parameters
-- Improve 'self-consistency' (multiple reason-based process approaches and ensemble voting for the best)
-- Use look-ahead approaches to find the best option
